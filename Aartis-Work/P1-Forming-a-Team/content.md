Let's break into teams of 3 or 4 people. You want to have a large enough group to give you a sense of development in the real world. In the early stages, most team members are positive and polite. Things change as you start working together, and conflicts arise. During the project, be prepared to resolve conflicts with code, design and working styles. The quicker you can resolve and find a good balance with your team the more velocity you can have on your project. Some tips to keep in mind as you work with your team

1. Define tasks and projects as far as you can
2. Agree on Design, Page Flows, Naming Models
3. Testing - TDD or not? The team has to agree
4. Git flow approach - Rebase vs. Merge workflow
5. Strength/Expertise of team members 
6. Pairing on tasks

The tutorial gives you iterations for each feature, so this makes things easier as you have checked points to help you retrospect and also stay on track.
