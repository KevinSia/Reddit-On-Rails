Each team should prepare a design proposal in Keynote. Assuming that each member of the team is already familiar with the basics of Rails and has built a few toy applications. The design should be somewhat in-depth and include diagrams, use cases and wireframes. 

1. First, come up with a list of use cases.
2. Dive into a few use cases and design some initial page flows. 
3. Discover and define the models.
4. Define the relationships between models, one-to-one, many-to-many, one-to-many and so on.
5. Research Ruby Gems you may need and list alternatives. Think about the Pros and Cons of using a particular gem. Is there a service available through the Cloud provider such as Heroku. Can you use that instead of a Ruby Gem.    
6. Look at common features or cross-cutting concerns across the whole app.
    How will an administrator manage the app?
    How will media be handled/stored?
    Will the app be internationalized?
    How will mail be handled?
7. Prepare a timeline and estimate for each milestone. 
8. Decide which DB you will use
9. Deployment: Heroku is easiest, but this is a good time to explore other Cloud services and their offerings.
10. UI, Pick a CSS Framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation.
11. Testing - Decide on Integration and/or Unit tests and the testing frameworks to use.

You can use any of the commonly used Design/Diagramming techniques. Don't feel that you have to make the design perfect, However, it is important that you have **some details figured out** before you start. Hand drawn page flows work just as fine. It's the code that matters.

Below are some examples to give you a starting point for designing.
