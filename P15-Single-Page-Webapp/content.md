You are done builing the Rails app. Congratulations. As a bonus convert this app into a single page webapp(SPA). Pick a Javascript front-end framework, either [AngularJS][1], [Ember][2], [ReactJS][3] or [Backbone][4]. Think about the parts of the application that would need to change to communicate with the JS layer. 

Some considerations during conversion:

Could you build the app in chunks, while making sure the existing app remained functional. 
Can you replace Coffescript with Ecmascript6 using sprockets or babel
How will your application get indexed by search engines
Can you use Gulp to [replace the Rails Asset pipeline](https://viget.com/extend/gulp-rails-asset-pipeline)
