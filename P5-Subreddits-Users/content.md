### Project Setup
Our first task is to create a new rails app. The whole team should pair on this task. It's going to be done once and than everyone will need to setup their individual machines. Once the setup is complete add a `Readme` file and push to github for future reference. Setting up a `Readme` file is good practice on any project, whether it be big or small. Deploy the app right from the beginning and deal with all environment/infrastructure issues. Make sure that everyone on the team has a running environment and can deploy before you start coding. If you created a Task for this in Trello or Asana mark it as complete.

### Users

With that out of the way start working on the User `User` model and their relationships. You may have to revisit the model and refactor later in the development process.

Write detail user stories on Trello, for the use cases that you decide to build.
