Let's build [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). This is not a beginner Rails project, and the assumption is that you have gone through Michael Hartl's [Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). By now, you have built a few toy rails applications and may have even deployed a few of them to Heroku. You understand the basics of building a Ruby on Rails app but to mirror a real world application you need to dive into something deeper. This tutorial is intended to give you an experience closer to what you may have in a professional work environment. Before we dive into building the app, let's take a quick glance at how Reddit was built and how it run's today. 

Reddit, as you might be well-aware is a highly trafficked site with over [1 billion page views](http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/8/26/reddit-lessons-learned-from-mistakes-made-scaling-to-1-billi.html). Originally built with [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_\(programming_language\)), Reddit was migrated to [Python](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit) in 2005, first using [web.py](http://webpy.org/) and later [Pylons](http://www.pylonsproject.org/). Interestingly enough, the [code that powers](https://github.com/reddit/reddit) Reddit is open source, and anyone can send a pull request to make Reddit better. In the Python world, the equivalent of Rails is [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). However, Reddit uses [Pylons](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) which is more configurable than Django. 

We are using [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) to build Reddit so we can focus on learning how to build a well-archited, stable and scalable webapp. By the end of this tutorial, you should have accomplished the following 

1. Understand the entire web application stack 
2. Learn how to connect the pieces together at each layer
3. Learn to select libraries, gems and services for your app
3. Learn to work together in a team with a shared codebase
4. Learn how to stress test and identify weaknesses in a webapp
5. Deploy and deliver a polished product

Getting Started

We'll be using *Classroom for GitHub* to manage assignments throughout the program. You'll need to:

1. Go to the [assignment page]()
2. Accept the assignment and follow the link to the created repository
3. Clone the repository and use it throughout this project.
