Let's build a Ruby on Rails app that has the same functionality as Reddit. Users can post links and content, vote, create accounts and create subreddits etc. Reddit is a highly trafficked site with over 1 billion page views, but has a very simple UI. 


Getting Started

We'll be using *Classroom for GitHub* to manage assignments throughout the program. You'll need to:

1. Go to the [assignment page]()
2. Accept the assignment and follow the link to the created repository
3. Clone the repository and use it throughout this project.
