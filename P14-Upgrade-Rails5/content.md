As an extra credit, look at converting the Rails 4 project that you built to Rails 5. This might actually be something you are asked to do at your first Rails job. The [Rails upgrading guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html) provides detail instructions and steps, however there are always gotchas that happen during an upgrade that may be specific to a gem you might be using or a configuration setting.

Go through this exercise and make sure all your tests pass and that you still have the same percentage of test coverage.
