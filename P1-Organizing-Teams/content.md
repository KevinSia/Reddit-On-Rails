Let's break into teams of 2 people. You want to have to work with someone else using industry standard practices in order to get a better feel of working in the real world. In the early stages, most team members are positive and polite but as the project becomes more complex conflict swill arise. Be prepared to resolve conflicts with code, design, and working styles. The quick you can resolve and find a good balance with your partner the more velocity you can have on your project. Some tips to keep in mind as you work with your team:

1. Define tasks and projects ahead of time.
2. Agree on Design, page flows, naming models and conventions.
3. The same environment is on both of your machines
4. That you both use the same git flow approach to resolve conflicts.
5. Determine the strength and expertise of each member.
6. Pairing on tasks in order to learn from each other.

We've set up this project so that you can split off from each other developing features concurrently such as you would in any large project in the real world. If you feel more comfortable, you're more than welcome to pair on the entire project.

We do not recommend each of you doing it separately. Being able to understand your partner's code and resolving issues is just as important as learning the concepts in Rails. It will depend on your individual learning styles and your partner.
